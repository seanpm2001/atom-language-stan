# Stan language support in Atom

Adds syntax highlighting and snippets for [Stan](http://mc-stan.org/) files in [Atom](https://atom.io/).

![Example Stan file with syntax highlighting](https://github.com/stan-dev/atom-language-stan/blob/master/screenshot.png?raw=true)

Originally the grammar was converted from the [sublime-stan](https://github.com/dougalsutherland/sublime-stan) Stan package,
though many changes have been made since then.

This package was originally developed by [jrnold](https://github.com/jrnold).

### Installation

The recommended installation is using

```
apm install stan-dev/atom-language-stan
```

Older (outdated) versions can be installed using
```
apm install language-stan
```
or find and install it from the Packages tab under settings.

### Features

* Syntax highlighting
* Snippets
* Indentation and folding patterns
* Sets configuration so `stan-dev` preferences: no tabs, two spaces
